# SystemRFID has been created for small stores using Nedap security gates. Its main goal is alarm activation when non sold product passes 
the security gates line. The RFID system consits of following modules:
- asynchrous sever receiving EPC read by gates,
- database containing list of sold and unsold products,
- software processing incoming EPCs to make proper querry to the database.
The list of sold and non sold products is updated by cash desk system.
